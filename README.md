 Welcome to the C++ Learning Roadmap and Exercises repository! This repository contains resources for anyone who wants to learn C++ or improve their C++ programming skills. The resources in this repository are designed for beginners, intermediate and advanced learners.

## Learning Roadmap
The learning roadmap provides a step-by-step guide for learning C++ programming. Here are the steps:

1- **Getting Started**:<br>
Start with basic C++ concepts such as variables, data types, operators, and control structures. You will also learn how to write your first C++ program.

2- **Functions and Arrays**:<br>
Learn about functions, arrays, and strings. You will learn how to pass arguments to functions, return values from functions, and create arrays.

3- **Object-Oriented Programming**:<br>
Learn about object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. You will learn how to create classes and objects, use constructors and destructors, and implement inheritance and polymorphism.

4- **Templates and Standard Template Library**:<br>
Learn about templates and the standard template library. You will learn how to create templates for functions and classes and use the standard template library to work with containers such as vectors, lists, and maps.

5- **Advanced Concepts**:<br>
Learn about advanced C++ concepts such as exception handling, file handling, and multithreading. You will learn how to handle exceptions, read and write files, and create multithreaded programs.


## Code and Exercises
The ***code*** directory contains C++ code examples for each step of the learning roadmap. The code examples are designed to illustrate the concepts learned in each step. You can run the code examples by compiling and executing them.<br>

The ***exercises*** directory contains exercises for each step of the learning roadmap. The exercises are designed to reinforce the concepts learned in each step. Each exercise contains a C++ file with the problem statement, instructions on how to solve the problem, and a sample solution. You can solve the exercises by editing the C++ file and running it.<br>

## Contributing
Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you find a bug or want to add an exercise, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you will need to have a basic understanding of C++ programming. If you are new to C++, we recommend that you start with step 1 of the learning roadmap.
### Prerequisites
To run the code examples and exercises, you will need a C++ compiler. We recommend using **GCC** or **Clang**.<br>
You can install these compilers on Linux, macOS, or Windows.

### Installing
To install GCC on Linux or macOS, open a terminal and run the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install gcc
```
To install Clang on Linux or macOS, open a terminal and run the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install clang
```
To install GCC on Windows, you can use MinGW.<br>
Download and install the latest version of MinGW, and make sure to select the C++ compiler option during installation.

## Learning Resources
In addition to the code examples and exercises in this repository, there are many online resources that you can use to learn C++.<br>
Here are some resources that we recommend:
